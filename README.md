Crime Mapping Project README
Overview
Welcome to the Crime Mapping Project! This project aims to create an interface that links First Information Report (FIR) data and generates hotspots of crime based on various parameters, including the type of crime, date, and time. The interface also includes a color mapping feature to visualize crime regions based on different crime parameters.
